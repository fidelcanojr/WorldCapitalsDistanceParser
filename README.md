This is a quick command line interface that processes latitude and longitude data from the world's capital cities to return a ranking of capital city pairs, ranked by the distance between them. Longitude and latitude data of the world's capitals is obtained from the following [open source database](http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals).

To return the top `n` closest pairs of capital cities, run:

```
python3 getClosestPairs.py n
```
